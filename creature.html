      <p>
       These are cone snail shells from Victoria. All species of cone snails are carnivorous hunters that use poisons to paralyse and kill their prey. Tropical species have caused human fatalities.
      </p>
      <p>
       The cone snails we find on Victoriaâ€™s rocky shores are nocturnal hunters and like 70% of all cone snails, they eat worms. The remaining 30% of cone snails are evenly divided between those eating other snails and those eating fish.
      </p>
      <p>
       As shown in the picture below, when a cone snail is hunting it uses its siphon to draw in water, tasting it for the chemical signature of its prey. Once prey is located the snail closes in, extending its proboscis towards the prey.
       The proboscis can extend twice the length of the shell and carries within it a harpoon. When the end of the proboscis touches the prey, the harpoon is fired into the animal and venom is injected.

      <p>
       This takes around one-tenth of a second, giving the prey little chance of escape. The venom interrupts the ability of nerve cells to communicate with each other causing paralysis within seconds and death soon after. The snail
       retracts the proboscis pulling back the dying prey which is then eaten.
      </p>

      <p>
       This hunting strategy relies on the harpoon and toxins. The size and shape of the harpoon varies depending on the type of food the cone snail hunts. Worm eaters have a short, broad serrated harpoon with strong barbs in the middle
       while fish eaters have a long smooth harpoon tipped with long curved barbs. All harpoons are hollow and connected to a venom sac within the snail, allowing for toxins to be injected into the prey. Once the harpoon has been used it is
       discarded and a new one installed in the proboscis.
